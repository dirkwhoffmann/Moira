/* On-chip caches
 *
 * The 68020 has an instruction cache of 64 longwords. The 68030 has an
 * instruction cache and a data cache of 256 bytes each, organized as 16 lines
 * of four longwords. The caches of the 68040 models are not emulated. They are
 * physically tagged, 4-way set-associative and support copyback mode, which is
 * a different design.
 *
 * Organization
 *
 * The caches are direct-mapped. An address selects a line by its index bits and
 * a longword inside the line by its longword bits. The tag contains the upper
 * 24 address bits and the supervisor bit, which keeps user and supervisor code
 * from aliasing the same line:
 *
 *   tag = xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx -------S     ( (addr & ~0xFF) | S )
 *
 * Two layouts exist. They differ in the line size only:
 *
 *   68020:     64 lines of 1 longword   index = addr[7:2]
 *   68030:      16 lines of 4 longwords  index = addr[7:4], longword = addr[3:2]
 *
 * Each longword has its own valid bit, so a line can be partially filled, e.g.,
 * after a miss that is served by a single longword transfer. Allocating a
 * longword in a line with a different tag invalidates the line first.
 *
 * Both layouts store 64 longwords. Because the longword number is addr[7:2] in
 * either case, the data and valid arrays are shared and only the tag index and
 * the grouping of valid bits into lines differ.
 *
 * Logical addressing
 *
 * Tags are logical addresses. A hit is served without involving the MMU, which
 * means that it can neither fault nor update the translation tables. Only a
 * miss translates the address, which also reveals the cache-inhibit attribute
 * of the page. Inhibited accesses bypass the caches.
 *
 * Cache control
 *
 * The Cache Control Register (CACR) controls the caches:
 *
 *   68020                          68030
 *   Bit 0 (E)  Enable              Bit 0 (EI)   Enable instruction cache
 *   Bit 1 (F)  Freeze              Bit 1 (FI)   Freeze instruction cache
 *   Bit 2 (CE) Clear entry         Bit 2 (CEI)  Clear instruction cache entry
 *   Bit 3 (C)  Clear               Bit 3 (CI)   Clear instruction cache
 *                                  Bit 4 (IBE)  Enable instruction burst fills
 *                                  Bit 8 (ED)   Enable data cache
 *                                  Bit 9 (FD)   Freeze data cache
 *                                  Bit 10 (CED) Clear data cache entry
 *                                  Bit 11 (CD)  Clear data cache
 *                                  Bit 12 (DBE) Enable data burst fills
 *                                  Bit 13 (WA)  Write allocate
 *
 * Clearing the enable bit bypasses the cache entirely. Lookups never hit and
 * fills never happen. This has to be checked on every lookup, not just on fill.
 * Freezing stops new entries from being allocated, but entries that are already
 * valid keep being served as hits (and are updated by writes). The clear-entry
 * bits invalidate the longword selected by the CAAR register.
 *
 * Misses and burst fills
 *
 * A miss reads the missing longword. If burst fills are enabled, the cache is
 * not frozen and the port is 32 bits wide, the remaining longwords of the
 * line are fetched right behind it (in wrap-around order). A burst fill is
 * only started if the missed longword is the line's only valid entry. A narrower
 * port needs two or four smaller transactions per longword and doesn't burst.
 *
 * Data cache
 *
 * The data cache is write-through. Every write reaches the bus. A write hit
 * updates the cached bytes. With write allocate (WA), an aligned longword write
 * allocates the entry. Writes never allocate in an inhibited page.
 *
 * Instruction cache latch
 *
 * Moira additionally keeps a one-entry "latch" (CacheLatch) in front of the
 * instruction cache. It records the longword last fetched, keyed by its base
 * address; a hit on the latch needs no cache lookup and no bus cycle at all,
 * modeling the CPU re-reading the same longword for the high and low
 * instruction word of a single fetch, or for consecutive fetches that
 * happen to land in the same longword.
