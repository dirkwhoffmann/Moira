 * When disabled, Moira calls the 'sync' function at the end of each instruction,
 * passing the number of elapsed cycles as an argument. In precise timing mode,
 * 'sync' is called before each memory access, allowing the client to emulate
 * the surrounding hardware up to the point where the memory access occurs.
 *
 * Precise timing mode is available only for 68000 and 68010 emulation. For
 * other supported models, this setting has no effect.

 * A client signals a bus error by throwing a BusError exception from one of

 * exception at no extra cost. The 68020 and later models can restart the
 * faulted instruction after the exception handler returns with RTE. To
 * support this, Moira saves the registers before each instruction, which
 * forces these models onto the slow execution path. If this option is
 * disabled, the 68020 family does not save the registers. A BusError that
 * is thrown anyway is still processed, but the instruction cannot be
 * restarted. This option has no effect while an MMU is enabled, because an
 * address translation fault is a bus error that must be restartable.

 *   MUSASHI: Compatibility with the Musashi emulator. This mode is used by the

 *   UAE:     Compatibility with the CPU core of the UAE Amiga emulator (as used
 *            in WinUAE and Amiberry). This mode is used by the test runner when
 *            UAE is selected as the reference implementation.
 *   MAME:    Compatibility with MAME's microcoded 68000 core, which generated the
 *            SingleStepTests. This mode is used by the SingleStep runner.
